I am a PhD candidate at the [Duke Sanford School of Public Policy](https://sanford.duke.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

<!-- My research focuses on ____. In my current work, I am using experimental methods to study the potential to leverage innovations in the design and delivery of social protection systems to increase household resilience to poverty and to extreme climate events such as floods. In the past, I have researched labour markets, inequality, poverty alleviation, poverty dynamics, and social stratification, using a variety of methods, including field experiments, and behavioural lab experiments.-->
